Xinis found that there was little to no evidence that Abrego Garcia was once an MS-13 gang member. Attorney General Pam Bondi said that ICE members have testified that Abrego Garcia, a former Maryland resident, is a member of the criminal gang.\\nKey Quotes: “As defendants acknowledge, they had no legal authority to arrest him, no justification to detain him, and no grounds to send him to El Salvador — let alone deliver him into one of the most dangerous prisons in the Western Hemisphere,” U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis wrote.

He is being held at a notorious prison in El Salvador, despite having a protected legal status. \\nThe Details: Abrego-Garcia's attorneys had previously filed a lawsuit requesting that the El Salvador government return him to the US, saying he has no affiliation to Tren de Aragua, MS-13, or any other criminal gang. Since he is no longer in US custody, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) argued the court cannot order his return to the US. \\nFor Context: Abrego-Garcia came to the US in 2011 from El Salvador. In 2019, a confidential informant alleged Abrego-Garcia was a member of MS-13. However, when he applied for withholding of removal later that year, a judge granted it. Vice President JD Vance falsely referred to Abergo-Garcia as a “convicted MS-13 gang member.” ICE said they were aware of his protection from removal, but he was still deported due to an “administrative error.”\\nHow The Media Covered It: The story was predominately covered on the left and center. Several outlets emphasized that Abrego-Garcia is a father. NBC News (Lean Left bias) added, “After finishing his shift as a sheet metal worker and picking up his child, Garcia was pulled over and arrested by Homeland Security agents…ICE officers allegedly told him that his wife had to collect the couple's child within 10 minutes or he would be handed over to Child Protective Services… She arrived and found Garcia 'confused, distraught and crying,' but she received no explanation for his arrest, the filing says.” Updated 4/7/25 to specify that Abrego Garcia applied for withholding of removal, rather than asylum.\\nRevised by the AllSides staff (of humans) after a first draft from our custom AI.

As part of its retaliatory measures, China has imposed stricter export controls on certain key rare materials used in high-tech products.

He was pronounced dead after being rushed to a nearby hospital. Anthony, a 17-year-old student at Frisco Centennial High School, was charged with first-degree murder. He allegedly admitted to the crime but asked an officer if he could claim he acted in self-defense.\\nFor Context: The altercation between Metcalf and Anthony allegedly began after Metcalf told Anthony he was sitting in the wrong seat.

In libertarian magazine Reason (Center), a writer noted that the confusion could be because Trump's words don't match his actions. Trump says tariffs will make us wealthy, but has a history of backing off if other countries comply with his demands. “If tariffs are the key to tremendous wealth, shouldn't Trump implement them no matter what the leaders of any other countries do or say?

The guilty verdict resulted in banning Le Pen from running for office, effective immediately and spanning five years, preventing Le Pen from running for president in 2027.

Trump said the new tariffs charge countries less than what they charge the US, displaying a chart comparing tariff rates between the US and various countries. The chart showed a 67% average tariff rate for goods imported from China along with the new US reciprocal rate of 34%. Economist Paul Krugman (Left bias) disputed the \"completely crazy\" figures, estimating the average tariff on imports from the European Union at \"less than 3%\" instead of 39%.\\nFor Context: The concept of reciprocal tariffs is straightforward: “They do it to us, we do it to them,” as Trump explained. He views these tariffs as a necessary measure for American economic independence. However, critics argue that such a widespread system of taxation could disrupt the global economy, potentially triggering a recession, and economists warn these tariffs could increase prices for American consumers during a time when inflation remains high.  \\nHow The Media Covered It: Yahoo News (Lean Left bias) reported on the tariffs with a focus on the potential negative impact on American consumers through increased prices.

It was not technically a filibuster as it did not prevent a specific order of business from moving forward.\\nKey Quotes: \"It should not be possible in America for one single man — even an elected president — to stop funds which Congress has already allocated,\" said Booker during the speech. He also expressed his intent to break the record of \"the man who tried to stop the rights upon which I stand,\" referring to Thurmond\\'s support for racial segregation.\\nFor Context: Thurmond delivered his record-setting speech in 1957 to delay a vote on a civil rights bill that ultimately passed and was signed into law; the filibuster lasted 24 hours and 18 minutes.\\nHow The Media Covered It: Raw Story (Left bias) cast Booker\\'s speech in a positive light, calling it an \"anti-Trump manifesto\" criticizing the \"dismantling of the federal government via tech billionaire Elon Musk\" and the Department of Government Efficiency.

The president was flanked by American artist Kid Rock while he signed the order.\\nFor Context: In November 2022, onsales of Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour drew the ire of fans and reactions from politicians. In April 2023, the Senate made a bipartisan push to enhance ticket market fairness when Senators Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Maria Cantwell (D-WA) introduced a bill that eventually was passed in May 2024.

Blauvelt criticized Gov. Mike DeWine (R-OH) for proposing a 10% increase in parenting and pregnancy resources rather than using funding for abortion centers that provide “essential, evidence-based health care.” She argued that pregnancy resource centers (PRCs) – which are often pro-life – lack accreditation by not having the same standards as other health care facilities, and, “Defunding abortion centers like Planned Parenthood contradicts the will of voters who overwhelmingly support reproductive rights.”\\nSupport for Pregnancy Resource Centers: “Pregnancy centers are called to help women, families, and their babies. They weren’t called to the rough and tumble politics funded and fueled by Big Abortion’s demands for abortion anywhere, anytime, and paid for by the American taxpayer,” wrote Jor-El Godsey for Washington Examiner (Lean Right). The piece referred to a report showing a decrease in non-abortion services at Planned Parenthood, along with an increase in taxpayer funding. Godsey argued that PRCs are no different from any other charitable organization dedicated to a single cause. He criticized the abortion industry for targeting and attempting to “demonize” PRCs that provide the choice for women and families to carry out their pregnancies. \\nSimilar Claims: Each writer argued that their movement is protecting life, and each accused the other of coercion. While Blauvelt called PRCs “entities known for spreading misinformation about abortion to coerce, deceive and manipulate pregnant people into carrying pregnancies to term,” Godsey wrote, “In a commonsense world, helping women have an alternative to abortion should be celebrated and supported by everyone.

The court sentenced Le Pen to four years of imprisonment, of which two will be served under house arrest and two years suspended, and charged her a $108,195 fine. Le Pen plans to appeal the verdict, but her ineligibility will stand during the appeal process. She will keep her parliamentary seat until 2029 unless snap elections are held earlier, but the ruling could halt her run for president in 2027. \\nFor Context: Marine Le Pen has been the frontrunner in opinion polls for the 2027 presidential race. This ruling serves as a setback for Le Pen, who has spent decades turning her right-wing party into a mainstream political force. Le Pen's allies said the ruling was politicized. \\nHow The Media Covered It: While outlets on the left and center called the National Rally Party “far-right,” National Review (Lean Right bias) opted for “right-wing.” The term “far-right” in American politics displays bias because what is considered “far” or “extreme” is subjective, but in Europe the same qualifiers are less subjective due to the multi-party system and don't typically bear the same negative connotations as in the US.\\nRevised by the AllSides staff (of humans) after a first draft from our custom AI.

A protester who tackled the leader for stomping on the Eucharist was apprehended as well. It is unconfirmed whether or not the Eucharist has been consecrated.\\nFor Context: A black mass is a satanic ritual that aims to mock and parody the Catholic faith. It often includes satanic worship and desecration of the consecrated Eucharist used for Catholic masses, and it may also be used in principle to reject organized religion and integration of church and state. In early March, the Kansas House of Representatives passed a bipartisan resolution that addressed the ritual as “anti-Catholic bigotry.” Gov. Laura Kelly (D) denounced the ritual but did not ban it entirely, arguing that a ban would infringe on free speech.\\nHow The Media Covered It: Media coverage of the mass was scarce across the political spectrum as of Friday evening. Most outlets that covered the story lead with the leader’s arrest rather than the mass itself, though few major outlets covered the story at all.

Many believe the charges are politically motivated. Despite his arrest, the CHP held its previously scheduled primary and named him its presidential candidate for the 2028 election. Widespread protests have erupted in response to the arrest, particularly in Istanbul, Ankara, and Izmir. \\nFor Context: Imamolgu is seen as a threat to President Erdogan, who has been in power for 22 years. His government has been accused of suppressing opposition and undermining democratic institutions. As of May 27, nearly 1,900 protesters have been arrested since Imamolgu\\'s detention.\\nWill the Protests Have an Effect? A writer for The Guardian (Left bias) noted that Imamoglu\\'s arrest has only made him more popular, and he would have won a majority of the votes in the election. A Time Magazine (Lean Left) writer was less optimistic about the impact of the protests, saying that Erdogan is not facing much international pressure to change course, so he can likely wait out the protests. \\nAmerican Influence? Dr. Andi Hoxhaj, a lecturer in Law at King\\'s College London, said, \"Erdogan feels more emboldened now, and so do other leaders with authoritarian tendencies – after the US retreated from democratic values – and now they feel that there are fewer consequences.\" He added that President Donald Trump\\'s funding cuts to human rights and democracy monitoring nongovernment organizations may affect the outcome in Turkey. \\nWritten by the AllSides staff (of humans).

Musk stated that the next million-dollar award will be announced in two days. This initiative is seen as an effort to influence the state\\'s upcoming Supreme Court election, which is expected to determine whether the court will have a liberal or conservative majority—the PAC pledges to give $1 million daily to participants in the petition.\\nFor Context: The Wisconsin Supreme Court race is scheduled for April 1, with a competition between liberal candidate Susan Crawford and conservative former State Attorney General Brad Schimel. The outcome of this race is expected to impact future rulings on issues ranging from abortion rights and union powers to voting laws and redistricting. The PAC has given millions to Schimel\\'s campaign.\\nHow The Media Covered It: The Daily Beast (Left bias) characterized Musk\\'s initiative as \"meddling\" and highlighted that he had previously faced criticism for similar giveaways during the presidential election.

Republicans have called the crimes \"domestic terrorism,\" and The Metropolitan Police Department is investigating them as political hate crimes. Meanwhile, Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN) poked fun at falling Tesla stock, which some local prosecutors have called a “breach” of his fiduciary duties because Minnesota\\'s pension fund has 1.6 million shares of Tesla stock. \\nHow The Media Covered It: Outlets on the left and center focused on the upcoming \"Tesla Takedown\" protests and emphasized that they will be peaceful, according to organizers. Outlets on the right did not focus on the upcoming protests, instead highlighting the hate crime status of Tesla vandalism, Gov. Walz\\'s comments, and Republican claims that Democrats are not standing against the attacks. \\nWhy The Difference? Outlets on the right and left displayed story choice bias because Musk has become a figurehead for the Trump administration in the eyes of many. It serves the interest of the right to point out when anti-Musk advocates commit criminal acts, implying that they shouldn\\'t be taken seriously.
